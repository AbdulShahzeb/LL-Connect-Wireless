# LL-Connect-Wireless

LL-Connect-Wireless is a **Linux daemon and CLI tool** for controlling **Lian Li Wireless Fans** using direct USB communication with the **Lian Li Wireless Controllers**.<br />
It provides real-time fan speed control, temperature-based PWM curves, and a lightweight CLI for monitoring system state.

This project is designed to run as a **system service** and operate independently of proprietary Windows software.

## Background

Recently I have ditched windows and start using fedora as my PC OS, as i have had enough of windows poor performance and optimization.

But one thing that frustrated me is that
my pc is built with Lian Li SL120 V3, which is controlled wirelessly with the usb controller, and there is currently no app that support it, so i try to make one by reverse-engineering the signal sent from L-Connect 3 app with wireshark

> Credit to [OpenUniLink](https://github.com/ealcantara22/OpenUniLink) for the methods to communicate with the wireless controller

## Installation

### Fedora 42/43

Go to the [Release](https://github.com/Yoinky3000/LL-Connect-Wireless/releases/latest) page<br />
Download the rpm package, and install it with dnf:

```bash
sudo dnf install *.fcXX.x86_64.rpm
```

### Ubuntu 22/24, Debian 12

Go to the [Release](https://github.com/Yoinky3000/LL-Connect-Wireless/releases/latest) page<br />
Download the deb package, and install it with apt:

```bash
sudo apt install *.deb
```

### After installation:

* run `start` command to start the service
* you can also use `enable` command to enable the service so that it will keep running if your computer restarted

### Build and package for Debian/Ubuntu

pip install -r requirements.txt
./deb/compile.sh
```

Install:

```bash
sudo apt install ./deb/.result/ll-connect-wireless-*.deb
```

Enable and run user service:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ll-connect-wireless.service
```

### Build and package for Arch Linux

Install build dependencies:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel python python-pip
```

Build:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./arch/compile.sh
```

Install:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./arch/.result/ll-connect-wireless-*.pkg.tar.zst

## CLI Usage

Full CLI reference can be found here:

[CLI.md](CLI.md)

---

## Configuration

Config file path:

`~/.config/ll-connect-wireless/config.json`

Curve mode defaults:

* `CPU_FAN_CURVE=50:27,60:37,90:70,95:100`
* `GPU_FAN_CURVE=35:30,60:40,70:60,75:90`

Linear mode defaults:

* `CPU_LINEAR=35:10,80:70`
* `GPU_LINEAR=35:25,75:90`

Fan groups can be assigned to different temperature sources:

* **CPU** (default): fan speed based on CPU temperature
* **GPU**: fan speed based on GPU temperature
* **Mix**: fan speed = max of CPU and GPU computed fan speeds

`GPU_MACS` and `MIX_MACS` store the MAC addresses of fan groups assigned to each source.
Use `llcw settings set-source <fan_id> <cpu|gpu|mix>` to assign fans by their monitor ID instead of typing MAC addresses.

Example:

```json
{
    "mode": "curve",
    "CPU_FAN_CURVE": "50:27,60:37,90:70,95:100",
    "GPU_FAN_CURVE": "35:30,60:40,70:60,75:90",
    "GPU_MACS": [
        "58:cc:1e:a7:14:54"
    ],
    "MIX_MACS": []
}
```

Curve format:

* Format: `temp_c:percent,temp_c:percent,temp_c:percent,temp_c:percent`
* Each step is a temperature (Celsius) and fan speed (0-100%).
* Values between steps are linearly interpolated.
* Temperatures at or below the first step use that step's speed.
* Temperatures at or above the last step use that step's speed.

---

## Stat Monitoring

You will see something like this when you run the monitor command:

```
CPU Temp: 52.0 °C
GPU Temp: 48.0 °C

 ID  Fan Address       | Fans | Src | Cur % | Tgt % | RPM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0  58:cc:1e:a7:14:54 |    3 | CPU |   32% |   35% | 712, 708, 710
  1  2e:c1:1e:a7:14:54 |    4 | GPU |   32% |   35% | 703, 701, 699, 705
```

## Permissions & Security

* The daemon runs as **non-root**
* USB permissions are managed via udev rules
* CLI access does **not** require root, except for update/uninstall

---

## How It Works

1. Daemon communicates directly with the wireless controller over USB
2. Device state is polled periodically
3. CPU temperature is read from the system
4. GPU temperature is read via `nvidia-smi` (if available)
5. Target PWM is calculated from configured curves
6. Fan groups use their assigned temperature source (CPU, GPU, or mix)
7. Fan speeds are updated immediately based on current temperature mapping
8. State is exposed to the CLI via a Unix socket

---

## Roadmap

Planned features:

* Per-channel custom curves
* GUI frontend
