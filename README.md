# LL-Connect-Wireless

LL-Connect-Wireless is a **Linux daemon and CLI tool** for controlling **Lian Li Wireless Fans** using direct USB communication with the **Lian Li Wireless Controllers**.<br />
It provides real-time fan speed control, temperature-based PWM curves, and a lightweight CLI for monitoring system state.

This project is designed to run as a **system service** and operate independently of proprietary Windows software.

## Background

Recently I have ditched windows and start using fedora as my PC OS, as i have had enough of windows poor performance and optimization.

But one thing that frustrated me is that
my pc is built with Lian Li SL120 V3, which is controlled wirelessly with the usb controller, and there is currently no app that support it, so i try to make one by reverse-engineering the signal sent from L-Connect 3 app with wireshark

> Credit to [OpenUniLink](https://github.com/ealcantara22/OpenUniLink) for the methods to communicate with the wireless controller

## Installation

### Fedora 42/43

Go to the [Release](https://github.com/Yoinky3000/LL-Connect-Wireless/releases/latest) page<br />
Download the rpm package, and install it with dnf:

```bash
sudo dnf install *.rpm
```

### After installation:

* run `start` command to start the service
* you can also use `enable` command to enable the service so that it will keep running if your computer restarted

### Build and package for Debian/Ubuntu

Install build dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip dpkg-dev build-essential
```

Build:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./deb/compile.sh
```

Install:

```bash
sudo apt install ./deb/.result/ll-connect-wireless_*.deb
```

Enable and run user service:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ll-connect-wireless.service
```

### Build and package for Arch Linux

Install build dependencies:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel python python-pip
```

Build:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./arch/compile.sh
```

Install:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./arch/.result/ll-connect-wireless-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

Enable and run user service:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ll-connect-wireless.service
```

### Publishing your build (fork workflow)

If this is not your repository, you cannot publish releases to the upstream project unless the owner grants you permissions.
You can still publish your own builds from a fork:

1. Fork the repo and push your branch/tag.
2. In your fork, create a GitHub Release from that tag.
3. Upload your built artifacts (`.rpm`, `.deb`, `.pkg.tar.zst`) to the release.
4. Share the fork release link, or open a PR and ask the upstream owner to publish an official release.

## CLI Usage

Full CLI reference can be found here:

[CLI.md](CLI.md)

---

## Configuration

Config file path:

`~/.config/ll-connect-wireless/config.json`

Curve mode defaults:

* `CPU_FAN_CURVE=50:27,60:37,90:70,95:100`
* `GPU_FAN_CURVE=35:30,60:40,70:60,75:90`

Linear mode defaults:

* `CPU_LINEAR=35:10,80:70`
* `GPU_LINEAR=35:25,75:90`

`GPU_TEMP_MACS` is a list of fan-group MAC addresses that should use GPU temperature instead of CPU temperature.
If a MAC is not listed, it uses the CPU curve by default.

Example:

```json
{
    "mode": "curve",
    "CPU_FAN_CURVE": "50:27,60:37,90:70,95:100",
    "GPU_FAN_CURVE": "35:30,60:40,70:60,75:90",
    "GPU_TEMP_MACS": [
        "58:cc:1e:a7:14:54"
    ]
}
```

Curve format:

* Format: `temp_c:percent,temp_c:percent,temp_c:percent,temp_c:percent`
* Each step is a temperature (Celsius) and fan speed (0-100%).
* Values between steps are linearly interpolated.
* Temperatures at or below the first step use that step's speed.
* Temperatures at or above the last step use that step's speed.

## Stat Monitoring

You will see something like this when you run the monitor command:

```
CPU Temp: 52.0 °C
GPU Temp: 48.0 °C

Fan Address       | Fans | Cur % | Tgt % | RPM
--------------------------------------------------------
58:cc:1e:a7:14:54 |    3 |   32% |   35% | 712, 708, 710
2e:c1:1e:a7:14:54 |    4 |   32% |   35% | 703, 701, 699, 705
```

## Permissions & Security

* The daemon runs as **non-root**
* USB permissions are managed via udev rules
* CLI access does **not** require root, except for start/stop/restart the service and update the app

---

## How It Works

1. Daemon communicates directly with the wireless controller over USB
2. Device state is polled periodically
3. CPU temperature is read from the system
4. GPU temperature is read via `nvidia-smi` (if available)
5. Target PWM is calculated from configured curves
6. Fan groups in `GPU_TEMP_MACS` use the GPU curve; all others use CPU curve
7. Fan speeds are updated immediately based on current temperature mapping
8. State is exposed to the CLI via a Unix socket

---

## Roadmap

Planned features:

* Per-channel custom curves
* GUI frontend (optional)
